# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Home page hero section to welcome team members with new professional messaging that remains clearly readable on the existing dark hero background.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current hero heading and description text in `frontend/src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx` with the provided welcome message (verbatim).
- Adjust hero text styling to use a clean, modern font and white or light-yellow coloring to maintain strong contrast and a professional agency landing-page look while staying responsive.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors to the Home page will see the updated professional team-member welcome message in the hero section, clearly legible against the dark background on both mobile and desktop.
