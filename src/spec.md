# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Admin Panel user list table mobile-responsive with a stacked card layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Update UserListTable component to display users as vertically stacked cards on mobile screens (< 768px)
- Position the 'Approve' button directly below the status badge within each card
- Style mobile cards with proper spacing, dark theme backgrounds, and minimum 44x44px touch targets
- Maintain existing horizontal table layout on desktop/tablet screens (≥ 768px)

**User-visible outcome:** Admin users can view and approve pending users on mobile devices without horizontal scrolling, with all information and buttons fully visible and easily tappable.
