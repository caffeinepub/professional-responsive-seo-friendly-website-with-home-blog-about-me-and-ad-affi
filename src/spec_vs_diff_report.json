However, the mobile UI fix for the Approve button in UserListTable.tsx is missing, and testing requirements cannot be verified from code changes alone.",

      "reason": "No changes to frontend/src/components/admin/UserListTable.tsx are present in the diff, yet this file is explicitly mentioned in the requirement as needing updates for mobile UI button placement.",
