  "summary": "The diff shows implementation of admin authentication credential updates in AdminPanelPage.tsx. The new credentials (admin/habibur123) are implemented with basic validation, sessionStorage persistence, and login UI. However, the diff is truncated and doesn't show complete implementation details, particularly around testing verification and security measures. REQ-145 (testing requirement) cannot be verified from code changes alone.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-145",
      "requirement": "Test the updated admin authentication flow by verifying that an admin can successfully log in to /admin-panel using username 'admin' and password 'habibur123', view the list of registered users, and approve pending users without errors.",
      "reason": "REQ-145 is a testing requirement that requires runtime verification of the authentication flow, user list display, and approval functionality. The diff shows code implementation but no test files, test results, or verification artifacts demonstrating that the testing has been performed.",
