  "summary": "The diff shows partial implementation of the BuildRequest. AdminPanelPage.tsx implements username/password login (REQ-169, REQ-170, REQ-171), and useQueries.ts shows modifications to getAllUsers without Internet Identity (REQ-172). However, critical requirements are missing: REQ-173 (triggering getAllUsers after login), REQ-174 (UserListTable with Approve button), and REQ-175 (useActor.ts modifications). The diff is heavily truncated, making complete verification impossible.",

      "requirement": "Update the AdminPanelPage component to trigger the getAllUsers query immediately after successful admin login using the simple username/password authentication, display a clear loading state while fetching, show the full error message if the fetch fails, and render the UserListTable component with the fetched user data when successful.",
      "reason": "The diff shows AdminPanelPage.tsx with login form implementation, but the file is truncated. No evidence of getAllUsers being called after successful login, nor any UserListTable rendering logic.",
