  "summary": "REQ-65 and REQ-67 appear implemented: global SEO title/description updated in siteConfig, HomePage uses global defaults, and SiteHeader shows the uploaded logo with SR-only brand text. Indexing support (REQ-66) is implemented via explicit robots meta tags in both Seo.tsx (runtime) and index.html. However, the header diff also introduces/retains a full navigation menu including a 'Work Tasks' dropdown, which is not requested and may violate the 'no new navigation items beyond what is required' non-goal.",
