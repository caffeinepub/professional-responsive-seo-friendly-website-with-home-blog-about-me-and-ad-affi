  "summary": "REQ-63 appears implemented by changing the Home Hero CTA to an external Facebook URL while keeping the label. REQ-64 appears implemented by changing the Mobile Menu \"Join Team\" item to an external anchor to the same Facebook URL, though the relevant portion is truncated so full verification of unchanged structure/label is limited. Additionally, documentation/state summary files were updated with unrelated claims beyond the requested navigation-only change.",
