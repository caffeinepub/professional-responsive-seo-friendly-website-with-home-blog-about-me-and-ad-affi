However, the diff summary truncates `blogSampleFallback.ts`, so it’s not fully verifiable from provided evidence that `samplePosts` contains exactly 5 qualifying posts with required fields/content. Several additional unrequested changes appear (theme/style overhaul, Tailwind config, social icons/links, extra docs/assets changes).",
